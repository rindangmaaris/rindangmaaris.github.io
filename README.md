## Getting Started

CalPo. is a web application was created from the CS50 course and written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Users can use the web application by inserting the information that they have. Then they can just use 'calculate' button to solve the problem.

Calpo is not only focus to calculate the solutions of Polyhedron's surface area and volume, but also edge, lenght, widht, height, slant height, etc. Based on [Wikipedia] writes on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron

> In geometry, a polyhedron is
> three-dimensional shape with flat polygonal faces,
> straight edges and sharp corners or vertices.

## Directory

CalPo. uses:

- index.html - code design of CalPo
- style.css - to make the CalPo's site becomes more beautiful
- script.js - add more control and animation
- README.md - userâ€™s manual of CalPo
- DESIGN.md - implementation and design decisions of CalPo

## Things to Improve

I wanna make CalPo. into the web application that more decent to use by public. There are some improvement that I wanna do for the update of it.

- Add more solutions from Polyhedron.
- Add picture for the Polyhedron.
