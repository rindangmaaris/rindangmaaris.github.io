CalPo. is a simple calculator that will help you to solve your mathematics problem about Polyhedron. You just need to input your data about your problem then you will get the solutions that you are looking for!

Calpo is not only focus to calculate the solutions of Polyhedron's surface area and volume, but also edge, lenght, widht, height, slant height, etc. Based on [Wikipedia] writes on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron

> In geometry, a polyhedron is
> three-dimensional shape with flat polygonal faces,
> straight edges and sharp corners or vertices.

## Getting Started

CalPo. is a web application was created from the CS50 course and written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Users can use the web application by inserting the information that they have. Then they can just use 'calculate' button to solve the problem.

## Using CalPo.

1. Users can access the Calpo. using this link -> https://rindangmaaris.github.io/. Then they will see the hero page of CalPo. On the hero page, they can see
![hero](https://i.ibb.co/WsXH2xr/Calpo.jpg)
    - CalPo. Logo
    - Navigation Bar (Home, About, Menu, Contacts)
    - Search Button (Go to Menu)
    - Hamburger Button (Showing up the navigation for the responsive of tablet and mobile phone)
    - Calculator Button (Go to Menu)
    - Hover Social Media Menu (WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube)
2. When users click "About", they will go to the About section. It's explaining the users more about CalPo.

3. Menu section is about the main of the CalPo. It contains some calculator to solve Polyhedron problem. Users just need to enter their data on the label then click "calculate" to show the solutions.

## Directory

CalPo. uses:

- [FOLDER] img : for image files location
- [FOLDER] js : for JavaScript location
    - script.js - add more control and animation
- [FOLDER] css : for CSS location
    - style.css - to make the CalPo's site becomes more beautiful
- index.html - code design of CalPo
- README.md - user’s manual of CalPo
- DESIGN.md - implementation and design decisions of CalPo

## Things to Improve

I wanna make CalPo. into the web application that more decent to use by public. There are some improvement that I wanna do for the update of it.

- Add more solutions from Polyhedron.
- Add picture for the Polyhedron.
