# CalPo.

# Calculator for Polyhedron

## _Showing the solutions in the blink of eye_

# Beginning Ideas

CalPo. is inspired how we need to check our manual calculation about Polyhedron. It might be easy for cube and right-rectangle but it will need more concentration and skills to count for prism and pyramid. That's why I made the design decisions if we need a program that can full fill our needs about that.
The implementation of CalPo. is we can use it to teach our students about Polyhedron. Because it's not only showing the result, but also it can show the complete solutions.
